That inspired me to become a graphic artist. I learned to used photoshop as my first app to create digital arts. The school which I had attended taught us about basic web language (HTML). That day my mind was astound by making codes. I did practicing everyday and every time on HTML languages and as well creating digital arts on photoshop. And without knowing, it became my hobby. As I graduated from my college, I pursue my hobby to become a job. And that's how I became of who I am today. My story My first designback in 2015 Way back 2015, I designed a packaging box for Nestle KitKat for their special event called \"Meeting of the Minds\". This project had been started from nothing which means I'm the one who designed the graphics as well. The client also wants to include the attendee's name so the production of the box would be layout multiple times on canvas that ready for printing.I also designed here the cutting marks for the machine and also the fold marks as you can see in this photo. Later on the client decided not just only the name would be printed but also their pictures. It was time consuming project but it was fun and excited as it was my first project for a big client."},{"page":"about.html","anchor":"myexpi","header":"My experience","body":"Over 9 years of experience and 100+ projects"},{"page":"about.html","anchor":"pricing03-5n","header":"Skill set","body":"Digital Graphics Design Video Editing Photographer Videographer Web Developer 3D Interior Design  Achievements Employee of the Year 2019 Most Innovative Employee of the Year 2019 Guest Speaker: \"Learning Robotics using Arduino 1 & 2\" Top Clients GREE Philippines San Miguel Corp.
